# Logical or: Returns ‘True’ if one expression is True

# Example 1
# x = 1
# print(x < 5 or x > 40)

# returns False because none of the conditions is true (10 is not less than 5, 10 is not greater than 40)










# Example 2:
x = 10

print(x < 5 or x > 4)

# returns True because one of the conditions is true (10 is not less than 5, but 10 is greater than 4)
